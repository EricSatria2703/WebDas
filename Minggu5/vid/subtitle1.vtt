1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.440
Challenge time.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.840
Lose five pounds in one hour?

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.480
Yep, sweat it away! Come on, then.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.400
No.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.960
Okay, it says here we must not be shot
or arrested,

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.600
as we drive across
the proud state of Alabama.

7
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.360
But we will get bonus points if we can
get one of the others shot or arrested.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.400
I don't understand. How do we do that?

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.840
You will therefore decorate
one another's cars

10
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.120
in such a way
to draw maximum attention to yourself

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.680
in this Bible-bashing, redneck,
deeply Christian part of the Union.

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.440
Decorate? I think what it means is,
we each have to write slogans

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.480
on the other ones' cars. So you...

14
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.040
-To get them killed?
-Yeah.

15
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.240
-All right.
-So, you do Hammond's.

16
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.720
-Take it away into the bushes.
-I'm doing yours. I'm getting you killed.

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, come on!

18
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.160
The South, the South.
It's Christian, short hair.

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.040
They don't like communists.

20
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.680
What is closest to their heart?

21
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.360
I've got to get him killed.
It is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

22
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.000
I'd be letting you down, me down,
everybody down.

23
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.800
Revenge for all those height gags.
Every time he's called me Hamster.

24
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.080
This is for every time
you've been late and lost.

25
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.800
Can you tell what it says yet?

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.880
James. I hate you for that.
I really hate you for that.

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.360
All the times you drove into
the back of my Cadillac.

28
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.320
-Yeah.
-Do you know, actually, I think,

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.480
honestly, we've all done a good job here,

30
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.120
but I do believe that the person
most likely to be shot

31
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.040
is indeed Hammond.
I think what you've done there, James,

32
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.080
-is killed your friend.
-Yeah.

33
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.240
Gingerly, we re-joined the open road.

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.600
Three religions down here, George
Bush, God, country and Western

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080
in that order.

36
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.520
Ascending order.

37
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.200
I'll be honest,
I have felt less conspicuous than this.

38
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.080
Here we are, sweet home Alabama.

39
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.120
They've shot their own sign!

40
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.960
What are they going to do to us?

41
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.800
To understand
what Jeremy's actually done to my car,

42
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.440
you have to understand that
this is deep Republican territory.

43
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.480
That woman is the arch-Democrat.
She is the Antichrist.

44
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.760
It's not just the slogan. It's the fact
that it's painted on a pick-up,

45
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360
a symbol of the South.

46
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.360
I mean...

47
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.400
And then Jeremy has written on
the boot: "NASCAR sucks."

48
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.080
That's a type of saloon car racing that is
very big in this part of the world.

49
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.960
This is where the drivers come from.
All the building of the cars is done.

50
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.920
All the supporters come from here,
and to say it sucks...

51
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.480
is a bit like going up and punching
somebody's sainted mother.

52
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.680
No! No!

53
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.000
We'd survived the highway, but then
we had to pull into a town for fuel.

54
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.480
Oh, this is... really terrifying.

55
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.560
Okay!

56
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
Just...

57
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.480
That's diesel.

58
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.880
That's... I've gone...

59
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.120
"Hillary for President,"
that's not going down well.

60
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.480
This lady was cross, but not as cross
as the garage's owner.

61
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.960
You!

62
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.200
Now, are y'all gay looking to see how long
it takes to get beat up in a hick town?

63
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.160
I'm not gay. I'm married.
I've got three children.

64
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:57.840
No, we're not. No.

65
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.400
We've just sort of decorated our cars
in a distinctive manner.

66
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.040
"NASCAR sucks.
Country and western is rubbish"?

67
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.080
Guess what, you're in a hick town, man!

68
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.760
-We're going to die now. That's it.
-Don't you dare! [bleep]

69
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.600
She said she was going to get the boys.

70
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.720
I'm gone!

71
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.800
So, we decided to scarper.

72
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.360
I've just remembered,
I've actually got loads of petrol.

73
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.360
And then, of all the moments...

74
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.560
-Oi, jump leads!
-You're joking?

75
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.000
-Jump leads.
-Not now!

76
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.240
This is going to be the quickest jump
in history.

77
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.120
You get the leads. I'll start it.

78
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.040
Tell your friend if he tears up
my parking lot again...

79
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.560
The rednecks arrived.

80
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.880
We've just got a slight problem here.

81
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.400
[bleep]

82
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.520
This is bad!

83
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.320
Then they turned on the film crews!

84
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.680
-[bleep]
-Hey!

85
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.920
Quick!

86
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.440
Rocks started pelting our vans.

87
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.800
Go! Get out of here!

88
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.320
What's happening?

89
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.880
[bleep]

90
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.120
For the next few moments, our TV
programme became a radio show.

91
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.760
Oh... [bleep]
There are the pick-up trucks.

92
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.000
Get your foot down. I think we've got
a load of them on our tail.

93
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.400
Something's going on here,
I'm telling you.

94
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.560
These three trucks that were in the petrol
station have now just torn past us.

95
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.000
We need to get these slogans off, lads.

96
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.800
Pull over, pull over.

97
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.360
Get the other side.

98
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.880
Got nothing to wipe it off with now.

99
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.480
With the artwork gone,
we hit the road... hard.

100
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720
I'm doing something
I never thought I'd do.

101
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.240
I am running for the border.

102
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.480
God in heaven,
that was actually frightening.

103
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.400
They could have killed us!

104
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.800
They really do have an irony deficiency.

105
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.880
I honestly believe that
in certain parts of America now,

106
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.320
people have started to mate
with vegetables.
